   ```
3. **Click**: **"Settings"**
4. **Scroll down** - Environment Variables might be:

## 📱 Alternative: Use render.yaml (Easier!)

Instead of using the dashboard, I can update the `render.yaml` file which Render reads automatically:

**This is actually EASIER** - no need to find the UI!

Let me update the render.yaml file for you.

## 🚀 Quick Solution: Update render.yaml

I'll update the `render.yaml` file to include the Python version. Render will read this automatically when you deploy!

1. **Click**: **"+ Add"** or **"Add Environment Variable"**

   - **Key**: `PYTHON_VERSION`
   - **Value**: `3.11.9`
3. **Save**
