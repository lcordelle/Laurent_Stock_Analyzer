# 🔧 Yahoo Finance Blocking Fix

## ❌ Problem
Render logs show:
```
Failed to get ticker 'MU' reason: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
MU: No price data found, symbol may be delisted (period=1y)
```

This error means Yahoo Finance is returning **HTML** (a block page) instead of **JSON** data.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

I've fixed the issue by:

1. **Added Proper User-Agent Headers**
   - Created a `requests.Session()` with browser-like headers
   - Includes proper User-Agent, Accept, Accept-Language headers
   - Mimics a real browser to avoid blocking

2. **Configured yfinance with Session**
   - Pass the session to `yf.Ticker(ticker, session=self.session)`
   - This ensures all requests use proper headers

3. **Improved Retry Logic**
   - Exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 6s delays)
   - Tries multiple time periods (1y, 6mo, 3mo, 1mo)
   - Better error handling

4. **Updated yfinance Version**
   - Changed from `yfinance==0.2.32` to `yfinance>=0.2.32`
   - Allows latest bug fixes

## 📋 Changes Made

### `utils/stock_analyzer.py`:
- Added `self.session` with proper headers in `__init__`
- Pass session to `yf.Ticker(ticker, session=self.session)`
- Improved retry logic with exponential backoff
- Better error handling for JSON parsing errors

### `requirements.txt`:
- Updated `yfinance>=0.2.32` (allows latest version)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Render will auto-deploy** (5-10 minutes)
2. **Test with tickers**: AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL
3. **Check logs** if issues persist

---

## 🔍 Why This Happens

Yahoo Finance blocks requests that:
- Don't have proper User-Agent headers
- Come from cloud servers (like Render)
- Make too many requests too quickly
- Look like bots/scripts

**Our fix:**
- ✅ Proper browser-like headers
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Rate limiting (delays between requests)
- ✅ Retry logic

---

## ✅ Expected Result

After deployment, you should see:
- ✅ Tickers work (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, etc.)
- ✅ No more "Expecting value: line 1 column 1" errors
- ✅ Data loads successfully

---

## 🔧 If Still Not Working

If you still see errors:

1. **Check Render logs** for new error messages
2. **Wait 5-10 minutes** after deployment
3. **Try one ticker at a time** (avoid rate limiting)
4. **Check yfinance version** in logs

**The fix is deployed! 🚀**
